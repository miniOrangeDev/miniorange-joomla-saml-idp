**Login using Joomla Users ( Joomla as SAML IDP ) provides SAML functionality for Joomla SSO.
 - SAML Identity Provider** plugin acts as a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IDP) which can be configured to establish the trust between the Joomla site and various SAML 2.0 supported Service Providers to securely authenticate the user using the Joomla site credentials.

Login with Joomla allows users residing in your Joomla site to log in to your SAML 2.0 compliant Service Provider. We support Login using Joomla users into all known Service Providers (SP) that support SAML Authentication. [Click here](https://docs.joomla.org/SAML_Identity_Provider_SSO_(IDP)) to know more about SAML Identity Provider.

Login using Joomla Users ( Joomla as SAML IDP ) allows SSO (Single Sign-On) login into Tableau as SP, Zoom as SP, Zoho CRM as SP, AWS Cognito as SO, Moodle as SP,  NextCloud as SP, Canvas LMS as SP, Absorb LMS as SP, Talent LMS as SP, Owncloud as SP, Zendesk as SP, WordPress as SP, Inkling as SP, Freshdesk as SP, Penapto as SP, Klipfolio as SP, Rocket Chat as SP, AWS as SP, Salesforce as SP, iPipeline as SP, Mendix as SP, LinkedIn Learning as SP, Tiled as SP, BlueJeans as SP, MindGarden as SP,  Workplace by Facebook as SP, AppStream 2, Drupal as SP, Shopify as SP, and all SAML 2.0 capable Service Providers.

This login using the Joomla SAML SSO solution provides SAML SSO capability to your Joomla site, converting it to a SAML compliant Identity Provider which can be configured with any SAML compliant Service Provider.

Joomla as IDP ( Identity Provider ) plugin functions only as Identity Provider, not like Service Provider but if you are looking to SSO into your Joomla site with any SAML compliant Identity Provider ( Identity Management or Identity Server ) then we can also provide a separate extension/module/plugin that enables Joomla to act as a Service Provider.
